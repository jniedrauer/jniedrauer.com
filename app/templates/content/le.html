It's $current_year. All web traffic should be TLS encrypted. LetsEncrypt came along at the perfect time. You can issue free TLS certificates for your websites, and it's literally zero maintenance. Check out <a href='https://letsencrypt.org'>their documentation</a>.

I strongly recommend acme.sh if you are going to implement LetsEncrypt.
