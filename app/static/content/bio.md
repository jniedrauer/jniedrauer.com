# What I've been doing

For the last few years, I've been running Devops at a Software company called Granbury Solutions, in Dallas, TX. Their focus is on the Restaurant/Retail Point-of-Sale market. As a result, I've spent a lot of time working on PCI-DSS compliant networks with Highly Available infrastructure where data integrity is key.

Most of that time has been spent migrating resources from on-premise and physical datacenters, to Amazon Web Services, using Infrastructure-as-Code provisioning and Configuration Management tools.
